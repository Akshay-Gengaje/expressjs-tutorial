In Express.js, route parameters are used to capture values from the URL and make them accessible within your route handlers. Route parameters are specified in the route pattern and are denoted by a colon followed by the parameter name. Here's an example of how to use route parameters in Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route with a parameter
app.get("/users/:userId", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.userId;
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this example, the route `/users/:userId` defines a parameter `userId`. When a request is made to a URL like `/users/123`, Express extracts the value `123` from the URL and makes it accessible through `req.params.userId` in the route handler.

You can define multiple parameters in a route:

```javascript
app.get("/users/:userId/books/:bookId", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.userId;
  const bookId = req.params.bookId;
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}, Book ID: ${bookId}`);
});
```

In this case, a request to `/users/123/books/456` would result in `userId` being `123` and `bookId` being `456`.

Additionally, you can make route parameters optional by appending a question mark `?` to the parameter name:

```javascript
app.get("/products/:productId?", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId || "No product specified";
  res.send(`Product ID: ${productId}`);
});
```

In this example, `/products` and `/products/123` are both valid routes. If no product ID is provided, the default message is sent.

Remember to use route parameters appropriately based on your application's requirements and the structure of your URLs.
