# Request Handler

In Express.js, a request handler refers to the function that gets executed when a specific route is matched during an incoming HTTP request. The request handler is responsible for handling the request, processing any necessary data, and sending an appropriate response back to the client. In simple terms, it defines the behavior for a particular endpoint or route in your web application.

Here's a basic example of a request handler in Express:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route with a request handler
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In this example:

- `app.get('/')` defines a route for the root URL ("/").
- The second argument is a callback function `(req, res) => { ... }`, which is the request handler.
- `req` is an object representing the incoming HTTP request, and `res` is an object representing the server's response.

Inside the callback function, you can perform various operations based on the incoming request, such as retrieving data, processing it, and sending a response back to the client using `res.send()` or other response methods.

Express supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and you can define request handlers for each of these methods on specific routes.

```javascript
app.post("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  // Handle POST request for creating a new user
  // Access request body using req.body
  res.send("User created successfully");
});
```

In more complex applications, you may also see the use of middleware functions in Express, which are functions that have access to the request, response, and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. Middleware functions can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, and more.

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Custom middleware function
  console.log("Middleware function executed");
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route handler
});
```

These are the basics of request handlers in Express.js. They play a crucial role in defining the behavior of your web application based on the incoming HTTP requests.
