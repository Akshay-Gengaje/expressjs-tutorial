# REST API status codes -

In a RESTful API, HTTP status codes are crucial for conveying the outcome of a client's request. Here are some of the most important HTTP status codes and their meanings:

1. **1xx - Informational:**

   - **100 Continue:** The initial part of the request was received, and the client should proceed with the request.

2. **2xx - Success:**

   - **200 OK:** The request was successful.
   - **201 Created:** The request was successful, and a resource was created.
   - **204 No Content:** The request was successful, but there is no additional information to send (often used in DELETE operations).

3. **3xx - Redirection:**

   - **301 Moved Permanently:** The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
   - **302 Found (or 307 Temporary Redirect):** The requested resource has been temporarily moved to another location.
   - **304 Not Modified:** Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers, and there is no need to retransmit the resource.

4. **4xx - Client Errors:**

   - **400 Bad Request:** The request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax or other client-side error.
   - **401 Unauthorized:** Similar to 403, but specifically for authentication purposes.
   - **403 Forbidden:** The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
   - **404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found on the server.

5. **5xx - Server Errors:**

   - **500 Internal Server Error:** A generic error message returned when an unexpected condition was encountered on the server.
   - **501 Not Implemented:** The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
   - **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes include maintenance or temporary overloading.

6. **Custom Status Codes:**
   - Sometimes, APIs may define custom status codes to convey specific information about the application-level status.

Understanding and handling these status codes is essential for both API providers and consumers to ensure proper communication and troubleshooting. When designing or using APIs, it's important to refer to the relevant HTTP specifications (such as RFC 7231) for a comprehensive understanding of status codes and their meanings.
